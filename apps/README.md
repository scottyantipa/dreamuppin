# Example Dreamup applications

Each directory here is a standalone dreamup app. Right now, our browser assumes that a Dreamup app contains an instructions.txt file. That is the minimum requirement for each app. Use this directory by running a static file server from the root and then pointing a Dreamup browser to any one of these directories.

Each dreamup app is currently a single sentence describing a single element. This is the type of training data that has been used to date to build our model.
